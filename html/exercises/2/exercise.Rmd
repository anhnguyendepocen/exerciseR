## Arithmetic Mean

To practice `for` loops we will write a function called
`mymean` which calculates the arithmetic mean of a sequence
of numeric values.

The arithmetic mean is defined as:

$\bar{x} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^N (x_i)$


The function should take one input argument as follows:


```r
# Example call of your function
myfun(x)
```

* Note that the function **has to be named** `mymean`
* You are not allowed to use the function `mean(...)`, `sum(...)`,
  or `length(...)`!

_exerciseR_ will check if your function works as expected.
