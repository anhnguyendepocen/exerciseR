## Find Index

We have a vector containing the names
`"Reto"`, `"Lea"`, `"Ben"`, and `"Heidi"`
in a random order. This vector can be defined
as follows:

```{r}
data <- sample(c("Reto", "Lea", "Ben", "Heidi"))
print(data)
```

Write a function which identifies the position of `"Reto"`
in this character vector (the index of the element
where `"Reto"` occurs in `data`).

Your function has to be named `myfun` and should take
up one input argument, the character vector as sown
above.

The function returns a single integer value with the
position of the ocurrence of the name `"Reto"` in
the vector.
